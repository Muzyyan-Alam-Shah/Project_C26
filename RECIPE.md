Recipe for making frothy cold coffee are:

1.In a big bowl add ¼ cup sugar, ¼ cup instant coffee powder. And around 1/4 cup of water in the bowl. I have used full-cream milk to make cold coffee. Full-cream makes the cold coffee frothy and creamy.

2.If you are using skimmed milk or low-fat milk then you can reduce the use of water in the mixture. Use two or three teaspoons of water when using skimmed milk to make cold coffee.

3.With hand blender whisks the coffee mixture. Whisk the mixture until the color changes from dark coffee color to light brown color. This will take you around 10-12 minutes.

4.When the mixture is light and airy and you can see hard peaks of coffee then turn off the blender and keep the coffee mixture aside.

5.If you have a blender jet then you can simply combine milk, sugar, instant coffee in it. Blend the jet to make a smooth shake. Add ice cubes directly in the glass. For a thick cold coffee, you can add the two ice cubes in a blender jar or mixer as well.

6.Take a glass and tilt it slightly. Add a spoon of chocolate syrup while rotating the glass slowly to make random shapes on the glass.

7.Add two spoons of coffee mixture in the glass. Pour cold milk slowly in the glass to create froth. Mix everything with a spoon.

8.Add two ice cubes if you like. Take a scoop of vanilla ice cream and add it slowly in the glass. Top it with some chocolate syrup if you like.

9.Serve the delicious cold coffee immediately and enjoy it at home with some cookies.
